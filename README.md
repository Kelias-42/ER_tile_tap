# ER_tile_tap
This is a game made for my custom bluetooth controller.<br/>
The point is to try to tap the colors in the same order as they are lit up, kind of like a Simon game</br>

# Serial port read
The code to read the serial bluetooth port in the get_serial.c file is not mine, I got it from this [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6947413/how-to-open-read-and-write-from-serial-port-in-c) and adapted it to my needs.
